    "  MySQL是一个关系型数据库管理系统，由瑞典MySQL AB 公司开发，目前属于 Oracle 旗下产品。MySQL 最流行的关系型数据库管理系统，在 WEB 应用方面MySQL是最好的 RDBMS (Relational Database Management System，关系数据库管理系统) 应用软件之一。它是一种关联数据库管理系统，关联数据库将数据保存在不同的表中，而不是将所有数据放在一个大仓库内，这样就增加了速度并提高了灵活性。\n",
    "  MySQL所使用的 SQL 语言是用于访问数据库的最常用标准化语言。MySQL 软件采用了双授权政策，它分为社区版和商业版，由于其体积小、速度快、总体拥有成本低，尤其是开放源码这一特点，一般中小型网站的开发都选择 MySQL 作为网站数据库。由于其社区版的性能卓越，搭配 PHP 和 Apache 可组成良好的开发环境。\n"

    "The bulk of the material in this chapter is relevant to both, and the examples will switch between them depending on what is most convenient.\n",
    "In the few sections that are relevant to just one or the other, we will explicitly state that fact.\n",

    "### Launching the IPython Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter, like most of this book, is not designed to be absorbed passively.\n",
    "I recommend that as you read through it, you follow along and experiment with the tools and syntax we cover: the muscle-memory you build through doing this will be far more useful than the simple act of reading about it.\n",
    "Start by launching the IPython interpreter by typing **``ipython``** on the command-line; alternatively, if you've installed a distribution like Anaconda or EPD, there may be a launcher specific to your system (we'll discuss this more fully in [Help and Documentation in IPython](01.01-Help-And-Documentation.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do this, you should see a prompt like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IPython 4.0.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\n",
    "?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.\n",
    "%quickref -> Quick reference.\n",
    "help      -> Python's own help system.\n",
    "object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.\n",
    "In [1]:\n",

    "### Launching the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell, and builds on it a rich set of dynamic display capabilities.\n",
    "As well as executing Python/IPython statements, the notebook allows the user to include formatted text, static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, and much more.\n",
    "Furthermore, these documents can be saved in a way that lets other people open them and execute the code on their own systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the IPython notebook is viewed and edited through your web browser window, it must connect to a running Python process in order to execute code.\n",
    "This process (known as a \"kernel\") can be started by running the following command in your system shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will launch a local web server that will be visible to your browser.\n",
    "It immediately spits out a log showing what it is doing; that log will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "[NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook\n",
    "[NotebookApp] 0 active kernels \n",
    "[NotebookApp] The IPython Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/\n",
    "[NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon issuing the command, your default browser should automatically open and navigate to the listed local URL;\n",
    "the exact address will depend on your system.\n",
    "If the browser does not open automatically, you can open a window and manually open this address (*http://localhost:8888/* in this example)."
