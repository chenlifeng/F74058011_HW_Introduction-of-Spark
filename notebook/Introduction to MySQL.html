<h1><strong>Introduction to MySQL</strong></h1>
<p>MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer. MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, eComStation, i5/OS, IRIX, Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.

<div class="article"><p><a name="1"></a></p><h1>About this tutorial</h1><p>This is MySQL tutorial. It covers the MySQL database, various mysql command line tools and the SQL language covered by the database engine.
</p>


<h1>MySQL database</h1>
<p>MySQL is a leading open source database management system. It is a multi-user, multithreaded database management system. MySQL is especially popular on the web. It is one of the parts of the very popular LAMP platform. Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. MySQL database is available on most important OS platforms. It runs on BSD Unix, Linux, Windows or Mac. Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook use MySQL. These sites manage millions of queries each day. MySQL comes in two versions. MySQL server system and MySQL embedded system.
</p>
<p>The development of MySQL begun in 1994 by a Swedish company MySQL AB. Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in 2008. Sun was bought by Oracle in 2010.
</p>
<p>MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, SQLite, Derby, and HSQLDB are the most well known open source database systems.
</p>
<p>MySQL is developed in C/C++. Except for C/C++, APIs exist for PHP, Python, Java, C#, Eiffel, Ruby, Tcl or Perl.
</p>

<h1>MariaDB</h1>
<p> MariaDB is a community-developed fork of MySQL, intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. It is notable for being led by the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle. MariaDB intends to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, ensuring a "drop-in" replacement capability with library binary equivalency and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands.

<h1>Definitions</h1>
<p> A relational database is a collection of data organised in tables. There are relations among the tables. The tables are formally described. They consist of rows and columns. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a database computer language designed for managing data in relational database management systems. A table is a set of values that is organised using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows. The columns are identified by their names. A schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language. It defines the tables, the fields, relationships, views, indexes, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, and other elements.
</p>
<p>A database row represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. It is also called a tuple or a record. A column is a set of data values of a particular simple type, one for each row of the table. The columns provide the structure according to which the rows are composed. A field is a single item that exists at the intersection between one row and one column. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in the table. A foreign key is a referential constraint between two tables. The foreign key identifies a column or a set of columns in one (referencing) table that refers to a column or set of columns in another (referenced) table.
</p>
<p>A trigger is a procedural code that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table in a database. A view is a specific look on data in from one or more tables. It can arrange data in some specific order, highlight or hide some data. A view consists of a stored query accessible as a virtual table composed of the result set of a query. Unlike ordinary tables a view does not form part of the physical schema. It is a dynamic, virtual table computed or collated from data in the database.
</p>
<p>A transaction is an atomic unit of database operations against the data in one or more databases. The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can be either all committed to the database or all rolled back. An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, returned by the SELECT statement. It also contains meta-information about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column as well. An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
